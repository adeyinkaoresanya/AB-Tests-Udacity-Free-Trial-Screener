    "Udacity tested a change on their website where if a potential student clicked the \"Start Free Trial\" button on the Course Overview page, they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they selected fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear informing them that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option either to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. The overall business objective for this new feature is to increase the likelihood that students who continue past the free trial will make payments and complete their courses.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Click-through rate:** This is the number of clicks divided by the number of pageviews. For this experiment, this metric will not move because it can not distinguish the outcomes of the Free Trial Screener between the experiment and control groups, as clicks happened before the Screener popped up. Thus, it will be useful as an invariant metric for checking that the experiment is robust for A/B testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Retention:** This is the number of users to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of enrolled students. This metric is expected to increase for the experiment group given that the number of students who go ahead with the free trial reduces without reducing the number of students who are enrolled past 14 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Gross conversion:** This is the number of enrolled users divided by the number of clicks. It is assumed that this metric will decrease for the experiment group because the number of enrollments is expected to decrease after answering the Screener question, given  that those who indicated 'Fewer than 5 hours per week' will not be encouraged to enroll.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Net conversion:** This is the number of users to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of clicks. This metric is also expected to increase for the experiment group "
